### My favorite line of code
```javascript
function spin() { 
slot1.innerHTML = `<img src=${symbol[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]}>`
slot2.innerHTML = `<img src=${symbol[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]}>`
slot3.innerHTML = `<img src=${symbol[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]}>`
```
I'd like to just throw in a huge Thank you to Rondell for helping me with this. He helped me not only add mym images to my array, but also iterate through each image randomly.

### My biggest challenges
- Computer Blue Screening Issues
-- If i would have tried  to code while my PC blue screening it'd result in lots of lost code, so I used replit and pushed it to Github after

- Trying to images in an array and iterate through it.
-- I spent my entire second first 2 days trying to do this.
-- In order to not fall behind too much, I used copy and paste emojis just to start getting some Javascript work done.

### My key learnings/takeaways
- Stop beating myself up when I'm low
-- Dealing with issues while also being stuck on a coding problem really made me start to beat myself up when I was down, which made thinking about a solution much harder. 

- To remind myself that I'm not alone and to ASK FOR HELP
-- I was scared that if I asked for help, I would be lookoed down upon, which caused me to waste time and be alone in dealing with my issues. Thhe moment I openned up about having an issue, I was helped immediately and able to progress; no judging me at all.
